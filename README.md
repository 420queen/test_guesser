Wikidata Guessr
===============

Guess the locations of random images stored in `locations.json`.

Based on [whereami](https://github.com/webdevbrian/whereami), a GeoGuessr reimplementation by [Brian Kinney](http://www.thebriankinney.com/).

## Offline setup

1. Place your MBTiles file at `tiles/tiles.mbtiles` in the project directory.
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`.
3. Start the local server using `npm start` and open the provided URL in your browser.

Any static server such as `python3 -m http.server` will also work, as long as it serves the project root.
